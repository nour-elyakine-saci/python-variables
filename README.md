## Python Variables
The python is a dynamic language witch means that we don't have to decalre a variable with its type before using it, the python variables is declared when we assign a value to it, and it takes the type of that value
```python
my_variable = 1 # type(my_variable) => int
my_variable = 1.0 # type(my_variable) => float
my_variable = 'python' # type(my_variable) => str
```
